    **A Few Takeawys** \
    1. Doing a smaller thing again and again make the harder thing easy.\
    2. Using AI Generated Code bring more unknown security issues with them.\
    3. While you may starting using AI for free, but sooner or later they might charge you for that \
    4. Thinking, of famous quote _**If something is free, then your the product**_

    1. Frontend Framework Evaluation Checklist\
        A. Assess Performance Needs: Evaluate metrics like startup time, update efficiency, and bundle size. \
        B. Team Skills and Learning Curve: Consider existing expertise but factor in migration paths. \
        C. Scaling and Cost of Ownership: Calculate long-term costs, including maintenance, dependency management, and tech debt. Alternatives often reduce runtime overhead, lowering hosting costs and improving scalability. \
        D. Ecosystem Fit: Balance maturity with innovation; pilot in non-critical areas to test migration feasibility and ROI.
    2. Monoculture slows web evolution when one framework’s constraints become de facto limits.
