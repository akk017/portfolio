After the tweet from Sridhar Vembhu, saying 
> Software engineer should consider other jobs

This caused tremendous confussion lately, kinda panicking situation. So here are my thoughts:

1. Humans = Chaos, LLM => Correctness and Perfection (Same answer for the Same Question no matter correctness, but this condition different between LLMs).
2. She considers LLM to be a black box, with ability only to the predict the next best word, trying to give the correct answer based on its training data, even if the training data is incorrect, it will produce wrong answer confidently.
3. LLM consider everything as puzzle, solve this equation, fix that problem in line54. yet given colours of rubrics cube with co-oraditantes, LLM fails to finish the puzzle because, it is not trained for it.
4. simply put, LLM shouldnt be compared with One Single Person Ability but LLM vs All Humans Ability (that includes, both doctors, laywers, everyone), then LLM cannot beat all human intelligence (because that intelligence is not in written format). If we create a puzzle tomo, give it LLM it cant beat, thats y they release new these version every now and then.
5. In order, keep the LLM in correct state, LLM has be retrainned continuously, and this process is costy which requires more resources and incread with training data, whereas updating a human nearby is not costly.
6. Now websites like cloudflare blocking web scarping, this training data is not going to be complete.

> Simply put, take Code Force for example, if an LLM is trained on training data from  2020 to 2024, It may
> solve the question set of 2025, the same LLM will fail for 2026 2027, but there is always someone to ask 
> and write solution for the same question set.

> TLDR: Rote learning will not work any work,  Learn by understanding, up skill yourself to solve complex
> problem. Mundane Jobs like, take build move to IDC, run set of QA and sent the report to boss,  raise
> request with same spec on all IDC and do follow up regularly. will be automated and will evenualty be
