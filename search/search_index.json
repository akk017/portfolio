It works like a dictionary where keys are object names and values are the objects themselves. A namespace is a container that holds the currently defined symbolic names and the objects each name references. These namespaces have differing lifetimes. As Python executes a program, it creates namespaces as necessary and removes them when it no longer needs them. Four Different Namespace Available: Built-in Local Gobal Enclosing or nonlocal Built-In Namespace ex. Exception, Primitive Types, sort, reverse etc. >>> dir(__builtins__) [ 'ArithmeticError', 'AssertionError', 'AttributeError', 'BaseException', ... 'super', 'tuple', 'type', 'vars', 'zip' ] Global Namespace The global namespace contains the names defined at the module level. Python creates a main global namespace when the main program\u2019s body starts. Globals are seperate to module Local Namespace function level namespace on enter of function -> create a namespace, on exit of a function -> delete the namespace. Enclosing or Non Local Namespace >>> global_variable = \"global\" >>> def outer_func(): ... # Nonlocal scope ... nonlocal_variable = \"nonlocal\" ... def inner_func(): ... # Local scope ... local_variable = \"local\" ... print(f\"Hi from the '{local_variable}' scope!\") ... print(f\"Hi from the '{nonlocal_variable}' scope!\") ... print(f\"Hi from the '{global_variable}' scope!\") ... inner_func() ... >>> outer_func() Hi from the 'local' scope!
